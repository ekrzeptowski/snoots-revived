I have lost interest in the project. Reddit's API is awfully designed and really not fun to work with, and all the projects I had in mind that inspired me to start this project have since fallen through or been shut down.

Additionally, Reddit's recent decision to effectively kill 3rd party applications with their API costs, and the continued public slander, misinformation, broken promises, and lack of care about accessibility by Reddit's leadership<sup>[\[1\]](https://redd.it/142kct8)[\[2\]](https://redd.it/145l7wp)[\[3\]](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23749188)</sup> has made me not want to have anything further to do with reddit or their API until and unless things change.

If Reddit makes steps to fix what they have broken, both their relations with their users and their API, then I might revive this project. But unless that happens this project is dead.
