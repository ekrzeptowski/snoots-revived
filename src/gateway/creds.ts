/**
 * Reddit API application credentials
 *
 * To get these values:
 *
 * 1. Log into Reddit and go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/.
 * 1. Scroll to the bottom and click 'are you a developer? create an app...'.
 * 1. Select the type of application you wish to make. Most likely this will be
 *    'script'.
 * 1. Put in a name and redirect uri (it don't matter what you put, but you
 *    can't leave them blank).
 * 1. (optional) Add your main account as a developer.
 * 1. The ID is just below the name of the application, and the secret is where
 *    it says "secret"
